Athletes are the stars of a sporting organisation. The water boy might be invaluable to the success of the organisation, but the athletes themselves will always be the most valued people within the org. Hence my journey to find an org. where the Product team are the athletes.

A company which valued the Product team, and developed its entire strategy with Product and Users in mind. Moreover, I sought an org. which utilised best practices in developing Products. A valued but dysfunctional Product team is still undesirable. This is how I did it.

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è ABOUT THIS BLOG

My pet peeve is fluffy, generic advice. *Network more, practice communication skills.*

Why, how, with whom? These are the questions I seek and discuss in my blog. The minutia. The nitty-gritty. Not unuseful wisdom without specificity.

As an aside, check out Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek‚Äôs thoughts on why he‚Äôs against wisdom: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKoGQpEkpO0>

Another aside, Tim Ferriss does a great job at breaking down top performers‚Äô mental models and frameworks with which they see the world, I‚Äôve found it very useful.

# ü§∏ Be an athlete

Contrast a Data Scientist working for YouTube, as opposed to the New York Knicks. The former org. is highly dependent on the Data Scientist to develop a good algorithm for YouTube. The latter meanwhile, only uses the Data Scientist to support their main stars, which are the athletes themselves. Ensure **you‚Äôre** the athlete in an organisation.

As a Product person, looking for a product driven organisation was fundamental. I searched for orgs. which develops great products and does so through implementing best practices.

My line of questioning is as below, split into two parts:

1.  **Determining Product and User focus, and best practices across the Org.**

    *   Organisation‚Äôs trajectory - are they a laggard or an innovator in management best practices.

    *   Are they proactive/supportive in developing talent?

        *   Are their ex-staff go doing incredible things right after they depart? This shows the company (or a specific leader) engrains a culture of talent development and develops world-class talent.

    *   What‚Äôs the turnover rate?

        *   A proxy for this is to check how long talent stays via LinkedIn.

    *   How big is the Product team compared to Sales, Development, etc.

    *   Talk to different parts of the organisation to gauge if Product and User centricity is within the entire org, and not just within the Product team. Talk to Analysts, Sales, Developers.

    *   What best practices are used in the Product and Development teams?

        *   Frameworks

        *   Change management

        *   Scope creep and non-priority creep - how do you shield the team from it?

            *   This question also helps you understand how your future manager leads and protects the team

    *   What‚Äôs your ideal vs. realistic day. Ask this to as many people as possible within the org.

2.  **Determining Product best practices in the Product team itself**

    *   What‚Äôd be my ideal vs. realistic day if I‚Äôm successful

        *   Product activities are generally split into two activities: Research and Management. I didn‚Äôt want to be in a space where I was bogged down with busywork - writing presentations or being a digital gopher. I wanted to have a lot of space to research and think about how we could create or improve products.

    *   Ensure that various stakeholders are brought into the product development process early on. A product team which builds products without consulting development, legal, support and sales is not a great way of working.

        *   Ask how pieces of work are developed in the product team, and how it‚Äôs passed on.

            *   You‚Äôre looking for cross-team collaboration and not simply writing up pieces of work, and throwing it over the fence to the next team.

        *   Can you tell me about your early-stage product development process?

            *   Here you're looking for signals that they speak to users early on to get feedback and then iterate

    *   Was there a time when the product received positive/negative feedback from users? What did the product team do about it?

        *   Can they point to a specific time when they heard user feedback and responded

    *   Have you ever had to pivot your product? Why?

        *   Again, looking for a sense that they are open to external feedback and willing to change the product]

    *   Ultimately you're trying to get a specific example of the product team being open to hearing from users and then acting on that feedback.

# üå≤ Some teams are like trees

They take forever to grow up. (Im)maturity of an organisation is worth examining. Most of the org, not just the Product team. A mature, high functioning Product team would go nowhere without an equally effective Development team (or Sales, Communications, etc.).

There are various stages of Product teams, all with their strengths and weaknesses. An APM at a well developed FAANG will have vastly different challenges to a PM at a 3-women start-up. Only you can determine what fits you best.

Understanding a huge company‚Äôs Product (and other) teams is quite easy - a simple Reddit search will present a slew of personal anecdotes. A smaller org‚Äôs much harder. You‚Äôll need to ask the hiring manager and other members of the org. to get a good sense of teams within the org. Leverage your network; perhaps they work in org., or better, they work *with* the org. in an external capacity.

My last interview was with a small company, and my line of questioning is as below.

*   What‚Äôs the history of the organisation and the Product, Development, Legal, Marketing, etc. team

*   What are the short/medium/long term goals of the team

*   What are the biggest hurdles your team faced/currently face/expect to face
