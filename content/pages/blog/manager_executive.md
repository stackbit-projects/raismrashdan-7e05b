There will be two layers of management pertinent to your role: your direct line manager (more pertinent) and the general Product business unit management. Ensure that your line manager will support your role and growth. Verify that the Product Executive (GM of Product/CPO/CTO) is a champion for product and users at the Board, and that they have the Board’s support.

### ℹ️ ABOUT THIS BLOG

My pet peeve is fluffy, generic advice. Network more, practice communication skills. Why, how, with whom? These are the questions I seek and discuss in this Journal. The minutia. The nitty-gritty. Not unuseful advice without specificity.

As an aside, check out Slavoj Žižek’s thoughts on why he’s against wisdom: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKoGQpEkpO0>

Another aside, Tim Ferriss does a great job at breaking down top performers’ mental models and frameworks with which they see the world, I’ve found it very useful.

# Hiring Manager

Research the hiring manager’s journey. If it’s similar (say BA to Product), ask how they’d feel taking up this role. Would it be more or less helpful in their Product journey than what they did?

There’s ample resources online for specific lines of questioning to determine whether the hiring manager will be a good fit for you. Through questioning them about the role and their team, I gauged their leadership style and determined whether we’d work well together.

# Product Executive

Check the organisation structure. A Founder/CEO/Upper Management/Board with backgrounds of product/user-experience will signal that the org. is product and user focussed.

A leadership team consisting of predominantly Sales backgrounds might bias the org. towards being Sales driven (great if you’re in Sales!). Contrarily, a founder CEO might be skewed towards developing great products for the user. The downside is that the org. might develop great products but struggle to juggle the finance aspect, so it’d be worthwhile to research into the CFO.

For e.g., Google’s bias is towards cutting-edge tech. Their rockstars are their best-in-class developers, leading to a sub-par product and user experience (see: Google+). Salesforce is partial to sales and data. Steve Jobs was extremely product and user focussed, still the main driver of Apple today.

If a product leader is one of the C-Suites/GMs, understand how much influence of the board they have. You could directly ask how supportive the board is. They could try to convince you that everything’s great, or they could say it’s terrible (this isn’t all bad! At least they’re honest!).

If the Board isn’t the most Product and user focussed, and you believe in the CPO, you could gain first-hand experience into her approach on how to gain the board’s trust to steer the org towards being more product and user-focussed. Do this by keeping your ear to the ground when this GM interacts with the board - how are they taking them on a journey to transitioning to being user and product focussed, and winning their support.

Gauge how much the CPO themselves are buying into the company. Perhaps they have share-options or relocated for the role. Keep in mind If they exit, you could be left stranded with an unsupportive upper management.

Being in a team with horrible leadership might be the best thing that happens to you. It’ll teach you everything not to do in your next leadership role.
