# **Why?**

A good interaction with a line manager gives you an incredible advantage. These include:

*   Your resume goes to the top of the pile.  A hiring manager’s has to balance their time-consuming day activities as *as well as* looking over a heap of resumes. Being able to shortlist one extra resume makes it easy for them. As a general rule, try to understand other people's perspectives (the line manager in this instance), and make their life as easy as possible. All whilst getting what you want!

*   You don't waste your time (and theirs). You'll get a sense of what they're *really* looking for in the role and potentially your future boss. It's best to learn that from the get-go, as opposed to further down the application process timeline. That'll help you narrow down your job-hunting prospects

*   Get insight into what the hiring manager's looking for; what'd make an ideal candidate, and what wouldn't? You won't find these secrets hiding in the job description.

# **How?**

Communicate who you are and what you’re looking for, clearly. Practice your “sales pitch" with peers: why you want this role, what's your unique journey which will make you a great fit for the role. See Conscious \*Link\*

Seek to understand the role in its entirety and determine whether the role aligns with who you are, and what you're looking for.

Ask what a strong candidate would look like. Ask what a weak candidate would look like. If you're up for it, be direct and ask what failed interviewers were missing in their skillset.

# **Understanding the role**

What's the main paint point the role solves. I always ask that on first talking to a hiring manager. Chances are, the job ad was written by HR, and it might not truly encompass the hiring manager's vision.

The hiring managers and recruiters I cold-called were very impressed when asked this question. Most interviewers would jump into the application process without *truly* understanding what the role entails. Don’t assume the job ad is the source of truth.

As a junior in Product (transitioning from Civil Engineering), I asked this line of questioning alongside my first (outlined above):

*   Is the Product Analyst role designed to support the PM to provide Analysis in developing new products?

*   Is the Product Analyst role new? Is it part of a new Product team whereby the organisation is exploring new frontiers?

*   Does this position already exist? Is this role a matter of increasing resources to scale the pre-existing team?
