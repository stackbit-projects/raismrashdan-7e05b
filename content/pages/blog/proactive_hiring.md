# Why?

Having a great first impression with a line manager can give you an incredible advantage. These include:

*   Your resume goes to the top of the pile.  A hiring manager has to balance their time-consuming day activities *as* *well as* look over a heap of resumes. Being able to shortlist one extra resume makes their lives that much easier. As a general rule, try to understand other people's perspectives (the line manager in this instance), and make their life as easy as possible. All whilst getting what you want!

*   You don't waste your time (and theirs). You'll get a sense of what they're *really* looking for in the role and potentially your future boss. It's best to learn that from the get-go, as opposed to further down the application process timeline. That'll help you narrow down your job-hunting prospects

*   Get insight into what the hiring manager's looking for; what'd make an ideal candidate, and what wouldn't? You won't find these secrets hiding in the job description.

# What?

Communicate who you are and what you’re looking for, clearly. Practice your “sales pitch" with peers: why you want this role, what's your unique journey which will make you a great fit for the role. See Conscious \*Link\*

Seek to understand the role in its entirety and determine whether the role aligns with who you are, and what you're looking for.

Ask what a strong candidate would look like. Ask what a weak candidate would look like. If you're up for it, be direct and ask what failed interviewers were missing in their skillset.

# How?

You've found a great job ad which you think you intend to pursue. Wonderful! In my experience, the people you want to directly contact are listed below, in order of effectiveness:

1.  Hiring Manager/Line Manager

2.  Recruiter

3.  HR representative

###### Hiring Manager/Line Manager

If successful, this is the person you'll report to. It's likely she was the one who requested an additional team member and wrote some form of the job description. Keep in mind HR might edit it, so it's key to try to get in contact with them first to *really* understand what they're looking for.

###### Recruiter

Some organisations engage a recruiter to hire. This helps them filter candidates without doing it themselves (they're busy, ok!). My current role used one, and he was the person I talked to first regarding the role. I had preconceived notions on working with a recruiter, as I heard they could be unaware of the organisation and the role, and simply hand over resumes that they *think* would make good candidates over to the organisation. I was could not have been more wrong. The recruiter was from a boutique recruitment agency and worked closely with the company for quite some time. He knew the ins and outs of the company; the state of the peripheral teams I'd be working with (legal, development, etc), what would make a good candidate, and was very specific in what the hiring manager was looking for.

I was lucky to work with an incredible recruiter, YMMV. He himself noted that he left a big-name recruitment agency as they were focused on volume, instead of quality. It didn't allow him to spend the time discussing job opportunities with candidates to ensure a great fit.

###### HR representative

I've not contacted HR directly for job ads, so I can't comment much here. My understanding is that whilst they might know the role, they don't live and breathe it like the hiring manager herself. Hence I'd only contact them as a last resort if my attempts to contact the hiring manager or recruiter fails.

### You know my methods, Watson

Put on your beige trenchcoat, it's detective time! To directly contact someone, take a look at the job ad. You'll often find the HR representative himself publishing the job description. Contact them and ask if you can speak to the hiring manager to discuss the role. I'm partial to LinkedIn messages. It builds my network and I feel as though instant messaging is less cumbersome than an email reply. A phone call or email works too if their contact details are listed on the job description.

> Hi (HR representative), may I please get in contact with the line manager to who this role would report? I'm trying to understand the role in greater detail, to ensure that the role and the team is a great fit for me.

If the job description was posted by the hiring manager herself (often the case for smaller organisations), contact them directly. If their contact details aren't listed on the job ad, use a site like [RocketReach](https://rocketreach.co/), where you can get their direct contact details. Alternatively, find them on LinkedIn and shoot them a direct message.

Don't underestimate good old nepotism, leverage your network to get an in with the hiring manager. Contact peers/friends/ex-colleagues who work for the company you're thinking of joining, and ask if they can put you in touch with the hiring manager.[](https://rocketreach.co/)
