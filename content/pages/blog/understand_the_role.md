Trying to understand a role before applying ensures you only target jobs that would be a great fit for you

Moreover, hiring managers would be appreciative that you’re proactively seeking to learn the role in its entirety. Contrast this with someone mass applying to roles without filtering them. This will set you above the competition.

### ℹ️ ABOUT THIS BLOG

My pet peeve is fluffy, generic advice. Network more, practice communication skills. Why, how, with whom? These are the questions I seek and discuss in this Journal. The minutia. The nitty-gritty. Not unuseful advice without specificity.

As an aside, check out Slavoj Žižek’s thoughts on why he’s against wisdom: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKoGQpEkpO0>

Another aside, Tim Ferriss does a great job at breaking down top performers’ mental models and frameworks with which they see the world, I’ve found it very useful.

# **Understand the role**

What's the main paint point the role solves. I always ask that on first talking to a hiring manager. Chances are, the job ad was written by HR, and it might not truly encompass the hiring manager's vision.

The hiring managers and recruiters I cold-called were very impressed when asked this question. Most interviewers would jump into the application process without *truly* understanding what the role entails. Don’t assume the job ad is the source of truth.

As a junior in Product (transitioning from Civil Engineering), I asked this line of questioning alongside my first (outlined above):

*   Is the Product Analyst role designed to support the PM to provide Analysis in developing new products?

*   Is the Product Analyst role new? Is it part of a new Product team whereby the organisation is exploring new frontiers?

*   Does this position already exist? Is this role a matter of increasing resources to scale the pre-existing team?

The interview process is to discover whether the organisation and the role is right FOR YOU. The more you direct the interview in that direction, the more it’ll seem that you’ve consciously thought about your career progression. This gives the hiring manager confidence that if you’re hired, you’ll be passionate and a right fit for the team.

Without this line of questioning, it might seem that you’ve bulk applied to job ads without a thought into whether the role is a great fit for you.

You *might* be applying to *every* job you come across for good reason. If this is the case, I’d still do deep research into the organisation and ask the hiring manager/recruiter the same line of questioning. It’ll position yourself as someone who’s carefully and deliberately applying for roles.

# Never work a day in your life

Ensure that the organisation’s product(s) are fundamentally aligned to your interests. Having said that, if someone like Google comes knocking round, maybe tough it out for that sweet resume buff.

Research an org’s existing products. Chances are these products will be your bread and butter daily, so ensure that you’re passionate about them!

In large organisations, they’ll have a huge suite of products, including internal ones which we might not be privy to. Ask the line manager what products exist and the which you can work on.
